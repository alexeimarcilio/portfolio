    "In February of 2020 Sonnet Insurance, in an effort to better understand employee satisfaction, \n",
    "hosted several employee focus groups. One group was held in Montreal and the other in Toronto. \n",
    "A separate focus group of team leaders was also conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word cloud is a pictorial display of a group of words depicted in various sizes. \n",
    "Words will appear bigger and bolder depending on the frequency they occur. \n",
    "Word Clouds are often used to display the frequency of words used by focus group participants. \n",
    "Focus groups collect data in an open-ended way in which participants are encouraged to give textual answers. \n",
    "Word clouds allow for a quantitative way to display this textual data.\n",

    "1. Each of the google docs which contained transcribed text from the three focus groups were saved as text files after the questions were removed.\n",
    "2. A function was created in Python which utilized wordcloud and take three parameters, including an input and output file.\n",
    "3. Additional stopwords were added based on the preliminary results. Stopwords are common words, such as \"the\" and \"and\" which are excluded as they have no meaning.\n",
    "4. Each dataset was loaded and a word cloud image (png file) was created for each focus group, one for Toronto, one for Montreal and one for Team Leaders.\n",
